    recommendation: `
Cole is basically famous at 4G Clinical. His first summer here, he was "the intern" somewhere in the middle of his time at college. I believe he anticipated a summer of fetching coffee for others but quickly learned we intended to have him actually help move some devops priorities forward. And boy did he help. And learn. He absorbed everything. You didn't need to explain things more than once, and he was off and running. At the end of the summer I told him he would be welcomed back the following summer or even during Thanksgiving/Xmas breaks when he was back from college - if he was interested. To our delight, he was. He helped us for another summer and multiple school vacations before we extended him an offer to join our team full time once he graduated. 

From bright eyed intern to entry level employee and eventually project lead, Cole continued to grow and add value throughout his time at 4G Clinical. Cole was as valuable as he was because he was not just following orders, but instead understood WHY we were asking him to do something and how his project fit into the overall technical/functional landscape. So while his technical skills were great, his understanding of our business was impressive as well. This is why he became the go to person for many of the areas for which devops was responsible. 

Cole is absolutely someone I would bring back onto my team if I ever have the chance. Best of luck, Cole. You have my number.`,

    recommendation: `
Cole is a pleasure to work with. He brings a unique blend of thoughtfulness, compassion, approachability, and an ability to think critically about complex problems. While at 4G, Cole grew to become a vital part of the DevOps team, particularly through his full-stack development work on a crucial platform that enabled every team at the organisation. He continuously pursued difficult projects and training to challenge himself and improve his skills as an engineer. It was sad to see him go, but it's exciting to see what challenge he'll pick next.`,

    recommendation: `
First and foremost, it is important to understand that 4G Clinical only hires promising, high-potential, and even brilliant people, and I feel privileged to have been a part of this company. As such, it was at 4G Clinical that I had the chance to meet Cole.

Like me, he was part of the DevOps/SRE team. The tasks cannot be listed here, however, it involved mastering the infrastructure, being Cloud certified, knowing our many DevOps tools, ditto for the strategic tools that enabled deployment, but also the lifecycle of our applications, providing developer support, and in some cases 24/7 IT support with respect, empathy, patience, kindness and the list goes on. In fact, Cole has always been available and willing to help, including me. As a team, we didn't count our hours, and many weekends were devoted with courage and pugnacity to the company's projects.

We collaborated together, shared knowledge and exchanged views through many discussions. Cole is talented, sharp, and not only smart but brilliant. I am proud to respond to his request with a letter of recommendation and consider Cole one of the fine and talented people I have had the good fortune to meet at 4G Clinical. His future will no doubt be bright!`,

Cole was quite beneficial to our DevOps team here at 4G. He was dedicated, hard-working and happy to help however he could. He was good about reaching out when he was stuck and could also take the initiative when given a project to run with. We're very pleased with his work here and I for one would be happy to see him back on any team I was a part of in the future.`,
