I took my first coding class to fulfill a college math credit. I was hooked.

Ever since, my journey has led me through a variety of disciplines, industries, and interests, with a constant goal of growth. It has also helped me realize my greatest strengths: organization, decisiveness, and communication.

I have been able to showcase my skills through a variety of projects. Most notably, I built and scaled a company-wide ticket automation site, slashing my teamâ€™s hiring need in half; I led multiple cloud cost reduction efforts, reducing total AWS bills by double-digit percentiles in all instances; and I increased applications to my team by 10-fold through rigorous restructuring and reformatting of the underlying hiring process.

My journey has taught me that I am driven by passion, curiosity, and quality; careful planning is essential to good execution; and that empowering colleagues is the greatest value generator over time.
