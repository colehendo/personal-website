# Personal Website
This is a personal website used to display my portfolio, recommendations, contact information, and a summary about myself. Written in Angular, the code behind the site displays proper use of modularization, compact files, and proper code organization. There are a handful of future improvements to be made, including the use of APIs, more dynamic CSS, and a joke of the day section.
